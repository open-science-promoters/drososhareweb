A basic Rshiny application exists here: https://colomb.shinyapps.io/Flystockcleaner/

<iframe src ="https://colomb.shinyapps.io/Flystockcleaner/" height=800px width=800px ></iframe>

It is also developed via github, for the moment here:
https://github.com/open-science-promoters/flystockcleaner


We would like to develop it further, especially add a functionality to share the stock list once cleaned...
