# Participation Guidelines

This project, participating in the Mozilla sprint 2018, respects Mozilla's [community participation guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines cover our behaviour as participants, facilitators, space wranglers, staff, volunteers, vendors, and anyone else involved in making the MozFest possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Don’t expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The Mozilla Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. It doesn’t matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.

We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

Our activities should be inclusive and should support such diversity.

## Raising Issues at #mozsprint

If you believe you‘re experiencing practices at #mozsprint which don‘t meet the above policies, or if you feel you are being harassed in any way, please immediately contact Zannah Marsh.

#mozsprint organisers reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone violating these policies, and/or take further action including expulsion from the event.

Email: askopenleadership@mozillafoundation.org 

## Raising Issues after #mozsprint

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at julien.colomb@drososhare.net. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is one of our core values, #mozsprint program planning is done in the open on Github (check out our repo [here](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint)). We hope participants will benefit from this culture of transparency and collaboration during the Sprint, and will continue to work with an open ethos in their projects after #mozsprint.
